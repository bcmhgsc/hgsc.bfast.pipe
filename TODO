DONE + run stats (and capture stats) 
DONE + email with run completed
DONE + add helpers dir (and add run_analysis)
+ incorporate capture_stats in the pipeline project (Currently outside)
+ separate the lib code into multiple files (1 file per class)
+ have multiple config files instead one big one. So:
  bf.config.yaml will become:
  config/
   bf.global.yaml
   bf.match
   bf.local
   ....
   bf.capture
+ running capture stats with the small datasets fails. Fix the capture
  stats so it works with small datasets (no reads on target)
+ incorporate the capture code into the hgsc pipeline
+ fix: ./lsf_logs//run_small_test.email_sucess.32366.out
