1 user the queue parameters to change queue in config
1 make the list of users in run process script dynamic (pull from config)
1 complain if analysis is capture but we don't have chip design
1 remove intermidiate directories when analysis completed
1 running capture stats with the small datasets fails. Fix the capture
  stats so it works with small datasets (no reads on target)
2 fix: ./lsf_logs//run_small_test.email_sucess.32366.out 
2 incorporate capture_stats code in the pipeline project (Currently outside)

DONE + separate the lib code into multiple files (1 file per class)
DONE + have multiple config files instead one big one.
DONE + When testing, we use a small reference, but in the config we are pointing
       to hsap. That makes the regen header job to take minutes instead of seconds.
DONE + add a check in the split process to make sure the number of reads splitted
       matches the original raw data
DONE + 1 lsf resources are currently hardcoded
DONE + move config stuff found in Helpers module to etc/ ?
DONE + run stats (and capture stats) 
DONE + email with run completed
DONE + add helpers dir (and add run_analysis)
