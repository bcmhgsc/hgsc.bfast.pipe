1 move config stuff found in Helpers module to etc/ ?
1 user the queue parameters to change queue in config
1 lsf resources are currently hardcoded
1 make the list of users in run process script dynamic (pull from config)
1 complain if analysis is capture but we don't have chip design
1 Singleton for logger ... instead of passing around the log object
1 add a check in the split process to make sure the number of reads splitted
  matches the original raw data
1 remove intermidiate directories when analysis completed
1 running capture stats with the small datasets fails. Fix the capture
  stats so it works with small datasets (no reads on target)
1 When testing, we use a small reference, but in the config we are pointing
  to hsap. That makes the regen header job to take minutes instead of seconds.
2 Add start/end walltime per job 
2 fix: ./lsf_logs//run_small_test.email_sucess.32366.out 
2 incorporate capture_stats code in the pipeline project (Currently outside)
2 separate the lib code into multiple files (1 file per class)
2 have multiple config files instead one big one. So:
  bf.config.yaml will become:
  config/
   bf.global.yaml
   bf.match
   bf.local
   ....
   bf.capture

DONE + run stats (and capture stats) 
DONE + email with run completed
DONE + add helpers dir (and add run_analysis)
